# expressjs-database

This project is a first-time setup for building an Express.js application with MongoDB. 

## Project Status

As of 2-16-2023, the project has successfully connected to MongoDB using Mongoose. Currently, a simple form UI is implemented, and I'm currently working on setting up the necessary routes. 

## Planned Features

### Future updates:

- Login page
- Cookies to keep user session active
- Automatic re-login after a certain period of inactivity
- Database page accessible after logging in
- Similar formatting to a previously-built PHP project
